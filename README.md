# J124 Final Project: The Cost of Injury of College-Aged Students in California
## By Paul Ikeda

## Data Summary and Explanation

This data was taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I am looking at the Web Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) data. WISQARS is an online database that provides injury reports (fatal, nonfatal, violent injuries, and cost of injuries) across the United States. For my project, I will examine injury reports among college-aged people, 18 to 22 years old, living in the United States. Furthermore, I will only be focusing on these causes of injury: unintentional injury, assault, sexual assault, legal intervention, and self-harm gathered between 2001 to 2020.

The data will be organized by race/ethnicity, age, and sex. The race/ethnicity is broken down by White Non-Hispanic, Black, Hispanic, Other Non-Hispanic, Not Stated. This data shows the estimated number of injuries, the population of each demographic, and a crude rate per 100,000 individuals.

#### Why am I focusing on this age group?

Based on the WISQARS reports, the 85+ age demographic is the most prone to injuries, and the second highest at-risk demographic is 15-19, followed by 20-24. Yet, I plan to focus solely on my peers 18-22 to understand why people my age are so vulnerable to injury.

This story aims to explain the causes and commonalities of injuries among college-aged adults in the United States. In hope that further research will show the psychological and environmental reasons for the higher injury rates.

#### Why am I focusing on unintentional injury, assault, sexual assault, legal intervention, and self-harm?

According to WISQARS, 18 to 22-year-olds are most prone to injury in this order: unintentional injury, assault, sexual assault, legal intervention, and self-harm. Legal intervention refers to "injuries inflicted by the police or other law enforcing agencies, including military on duty, in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest lawbreakers, suppressing disturbances, maintaining order, and other legal actions. Excludes injuries caused by civil insurrections." This definition comes straight from the CDC.
